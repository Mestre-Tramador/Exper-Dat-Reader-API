The Exper-Dat-Reader API is a backend project based on an old test to an job
application which required a PHP/JS system to read encrypted `.dat` files and
dump their data into `.done.dat` files.

Currently, there are **2** supported routes, which can be checked [here](./docs/ROUTES.md).

**More soon!**
